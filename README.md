# CREDIT-CARD-SPEND-PREDICTION

One of the global banks needed to understand what factors were driving credit card spend.
The bank wanted to use these insights to calculate credit limit. 

Our objective was to understand what's driving the total spend (Primary Card + Secondary card). Based on the factors we created the model to predict credit limit for the new applicants.
